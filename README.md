# 1.Project Overview

## 1.1 Project Objective

- The main purpose of this website is to promote a non-profit psychotherapeutic organization.

 - The main purpose of this organization is to encourage people who are struggling with their daily life problems to ask support from experienced professionals. 

  - The user of the website has the opportunity to:

      1. Get brief description of the people who work there. 
      2. Learn more about the purpose, and the way the organization operates.
      3. Read more information about the theoretical basis of this group.
      4. Get in touch to request support.

- The target audience is every person who is struggling with daily-life problems and would like to ask for phychological support.

## 1.2 User stories

### First time user 
- I want to know about what the website is about.
- I want to know more about the people of this organization.
- I want to know what this organization offers.
- I want to know how they provide their services.

### Returning Users 

- I want to know more about the way they operate.
 - I want to know in more details in which areas they can provide support.
- I want to know how I can get in touch.


### Site owner

- I want to promote the activity of the organization. 
- I want to provide information about the importance of the well-being.
- I want to encourage the users to take action in order to improve their life. 
- I want to get in touch with the organization.


# 1.3 Design


 - The website was designed to provide only the necessery information about the organization. If the users want to learn more about the organization and ask suppoort they are encouraged through the website to get in touch by sumbitting the form, which is and the final goal of the website. The point is the context of the pages to be short and accurate so as to keep the user's interest without being tiring. 

   In order to fullfill this purpose, a simple minimalistic design was necessary. To draw the attention of the user I used images relevant to the context of each section. The user can find relevant information about the organization and their way to operate by scrolling down the page or following the navigation links provided in the header.

 - Semantic markup was used to ensure a well structured page.

 - The colour of the page is light green in order to convey happy feelings and it was choosen to match the concept of well- being. The header and the footer has a slightly lighter green color. The point of the different colour betwwen the footer, header and main body is the user to be able to identify the different sectors but at the same time not to create a strong contrast between them. 

   The colour of the the body is a dark green in order to create strong contrast between the background colour and be easily readable. At the same time all the colours of the website match together.

-  Media Queries were used to allow for the layout to adapt to all screen sizes maintaining the structural integrity of the website.

-  I used Flexbox in order to display the elements of the page in a column. With that way the user easily read the sections just by scrolling down through the page both on mobile screens and on desktop computers.





# 2. Features

The website includes three pages. 
1. The [Home page](https://georgebarh.github.io/well-being-Portofolio-1/) that contains information about the organization.

This page gives the user the oppurtunity to check how the organization operates, where they base their buisness plan and in which areas of their life they can provide guidance to them. 

### __Introduction__

This section contains the title *The Three pillars of Well-Being*, a nav bar which the user can user so as to navigate through the three sections of the page *(Health, Social Connections and Financial Stability)* and a paragraph that describes the rest of the page's context and encourages the user to read more.

- Each section contains a heading, an image, relevant to the concept of the section,so as to draw the attention of the user and three sub-categories of each pillar.

- Each section has box shadow around them so as to make it look as a seperate card and improve the user experience and the look of the website.

- The purpose of this design is to get the attention of user and  provide them further information about the areas of life that can get support from the Well-Being team without make the context long and tiring.

- Footer 
  - The footer contains three font awesome icons that each of them links the user to the corresponding social media page. The pages are opening in a new tab in order the user not leave the home page.

  ## [About us Page](https://georgebarh.github.io/well-being-Portofolio-1/index.html#about)

   Except of the navbar in the header, the *About us* page has two anchor links that encourages the user to navigate to the other two pages of the website. Both elements are tested and working as they should.

     1. At the *WHAT WE DO* section the user has the option to click the *Read more* anchor and link to the [Categories page](https://georgebarh.github.io/well-being-Portofolio-1/categories.html).

     ## [Categories page](https://georgebarh.github.io/well-being-Portofolio-1/categories.html)

 - At the top of the page, in the center of introduction div there is a navbar that gives the option to the user to click them and navigate to the sections of the Categories Page.

 The purpose of navigation bar at the top of the page is the user to be able to choose the area that he wants to learn more about without having to scroll down the page to find what he is more interested in.

   1. *The Health* anchor links to the [Health section](https://georgebarh.github.io/well-being-Portofolio-1/categories.html#health) of the Categories Page.
   2. The *Social Connections* anchor links to the [Social section](https://georgebarh.github.io/well-being-Portofolio-1/categories.html#social) of the Categories Page.
   3. The *Financial Stability* anchor links to the [Finance section](https://georgebarh.github.io/well-being-Portofolio-1/categories.html#finance) of the Categories Page.

  ![Screenshot of the nav bar in the Categories Page](assets\images\readme\nav-bar-categories.png)

   - Below the navigation bar there is a paragraph that describes that follows in the page. In this paragraph the anchor *Read below* that when the user clicks it navigates them to the [Health section](https://georgebarh.github.io/well-being-Portofolio-1/categories.html#health) of the Categories Page so as to start read more details.

   ![Screenshot of the Read Below anchor link in the Categories Page](assets\images\readme\read-below.png)

  
  That anchor links give the chance to the user (mostly to the mobile user) not to scroll down and provides interactivity so as to make the website more user friendly.

  - At the bottom of the Categories page there is another anchor link that encourages the user to book a call with the Well-being team.

   ![Screenshot of the Click Here anchor link at the bottom of the Categories Page](assets\images\readme\click-here.png)



  ## [Book a Call page](https://georgebarh.github.io/well-being-Portofolio-1/contact.html)
  - The form contains eight input fields that the user has to fill in in order to be able to sumbit the form. Only the six of the them are required. 
      1. The *Phone Number* is a non required field because a lot of users are hesitating to provide such a sensitive information and it is possible not to sumbit the form for that reason.
      2. The *Areas you want to improve* field is a non required because is working as an indication for the Well-Being team and gives the user a sense of control about the upcoming appointment.

      ![Screenshot of the form with the required fields filled in](assets\images\readme\form-test-1.png)
      ![Screenshot of the form with the required fields filled in](assets\images\readme\form-test-2.png)

 ## 3.2 Bugs 


 1. In the *Book a call* page the *about us* anchor link of the navigation bar could not link to the proper element.
 ![Screenshot of the above bug](assets/images/readme/about-us-bug.png)

  After research in the Stack Overflow I realised that I had to write the following.

  ![Screenshot of the above solution](assets/images/readme/about-us-solution.png)

  ### __Lighthouse - Performance__
 
  After the lighthouse overview in the Chrome DevTools I realised that the performance of website was very poor because of delay to load the background images. 
    - Based on the DevTools instructions I preloaded both of the background images in the head element.

  ![Screenshot of the hero image preload](assets/images/readme/preload-hero.png)

  ![Screenshot of the booking image preload](assets/images/readme/preload-booking.png)

   In order to further improve the performance of the website I converted the  background images from .jpg to webp after the instruction of the Chrome DevTools.

   ### __Lighthouse - Accessibility__
  - I confirmed that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighhouse in DevTools.

  ![Screenshot of Lighthouse score](assets/images/readme/lighthouse.png)
